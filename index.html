<h1> "The Beginning</h1>
<p> "The DreamSMP was just supposed to be a Minecraft survival world. The first person to join(other than Dream), was Georgenotfound. But eventually more and more people joined. But things started going down hill when Wilbur Soot and Tommyinnit joined the server. (Just a side note, all of the lore is scripted. From here on to a certain point, Wilbur is the one who wrote the script). Wilbur and Tommy decided to make their own little country called L’Manburg. Dream was okay with it at first. As more people started to join L’Manburg, Wilbur wanted independence. And of course, Dream didn’t like that. So Dream, George, Sapnap, and Punz(I think), declared war on L’Manburg. And Wilbur excepted. </p>
